# SingingCV, built via Django

This website serves as my personal promotion page but also as a singing curriculum vitae, keeping a record of what and where I sing. Anyone checking out this repo is welcome to take a look at how I do things - I have a moderately complex SQLIte setup with several different entities and joins - but do be aware that this is my first Django project and almost certainly will not be optimally designed or programmed. Best of luck!
